Alternative conversion factors are used in the Atlas methodology and elsewhere in World Development Indicators as single-year conversion factors.\\nMontenegro declared independence from Serbia and Montenegro on June 3, 2006. Where available, data for each country are shown separately. However, for Serbia, some indicators, such as those series for which data appear only for Serbia and not Montenegro--e.g., aid, environment, external debt, balance of payments, various social indicators excluding population--continue to include data for Montenegro through 2005. Moreover, data from 1999 onward for Serbia for most indicators exclude data for Kosovo, 1999 being the year when Kosovo became a territory under international administration pursuant to UN Security Council Resolution 1244 (1999); any exceptions are noted. Kosovo became a World Bank member on June 29, 2009; available data are shown separately for Kosovo. In 2011, the Statistical Office of Serbia improved the methodology of national accounts data for 2003 onward. Specifically, the classification of sectors was revised.\\nnan\\nThe reporting period for national accounts data is designated as either calendar year basis (CY) or fiscal year basis (FY). For this country, it is fiscal year-based (fiscal year-end: June 30).

In this country, multiple or dual exchange rate activity exists and must be accounted for appropriately in underlying statistics. An alternative estimate (“alternative conversion factor” - PA.NUS.ATLS) is thus calculated as a weighted average of the different exchange rates in use in the country. Doing so better reflects economic reality and leads to more accurate cross-country comparisons and country classifications by income level. For this country, this applies to 1989-2022.
